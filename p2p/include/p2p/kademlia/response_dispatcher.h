 * @brief ResponseDispatcher manages the association between response callbacks
 * and awaited response messages.
 *
 * The RPC protocol is simple. A single query packet is sent out and a single
 * packet is sent in response. The response is associated to the request through
 * a id (Hash160) sent in the response packet and must be echoed in the response
 * packet.
 *
 * Using the request/response id, a callback for handling the response and a
 * callback for handling errors can be registered with the ResponseDispatcher.
 *
 * To avoid waiting indefinitely for a never coming response, the callback
 * registration is made only for a certain duration after which the callback is
 * removed. Any received response with an id for which no callback is registered
 * is simply discarded.
