## Vulnerability reporting (security issues)

We gratefully welcome vulnerability reports!

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one,
please send an email to the security contacts that you have such
information, and we'll tell you the next steps.

For now, the security contacts are listed in the AUTHORS file at the root of
this project's repository.

Please use an email system (like Gmail) that supports
hop-to-hop encryption using STARTTLS when reporting vulnerabilities.
Examples of such systems include Gmail, Outlook.com, and runbox.com.
See [STARTTLS Everywhere](https://starttls-everywhere.org/)
if you wish to learn more about efforts to encourage the use of STARTTLS.
Your email client should use encryption to communicate with
your email system (i.e., if you use a web-based email client then use HTTPS,
and if you use email client software then configure it to use encryption).
Hop-to-hop encryption isn't as strong as end-to-end encryption,
but we've decided that it's strong enough for this purpose
and it's much easier to get everyone to use it.

We will gladly give credit to anyone who reports a vulnerability
so that we can fix it.
If you want to remain anonymous or pseudonymous instead,
please let us know that; we will gladly respect your wishes.
